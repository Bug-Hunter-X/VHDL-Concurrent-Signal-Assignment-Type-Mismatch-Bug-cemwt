This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VHDL related to type mismatches in concurrent signal assignments. The bug is characterized by a lack of compiler errors or warnings, but simulation results deviate from the expected behavior. The solution provides a corrected version with explicit type conversions, illustrating best practices for avoiding such issues. The `bug.vhd` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.vhd` shows the corrected version.
